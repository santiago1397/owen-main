"""Asterisk ARI probes — read-only reachability checks for /health/telephony.

Only exercised when ASTERISK_ENABLED. Talks to the ARI REST interface over the docker
host-gateway (host.docker.internal:8088 by default), authenticated with the ARI creds
from env. Every probe is best-effort: it returns a bool and never raises, so the
non-gating telephony healthcheck can report status without ever failing the request.

This adds NO background work and is imported by nothing on the existing hot paths — it
is inert unless /health/telephony is called with the flag on.
